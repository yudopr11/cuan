## Getting Started

cd cuan
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables (if applicable)

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your configuration.

4. Start development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The build output will be in the `dist` directory.

## Progressive Web App (PWA)

Cuan is available as a Progressive Web App, which means you can:

* **Install on your device**: Add it to your home screen on mobile or desktop
* **Work offline**: Continue using the app even without an internet connection
* **Faster loading**: Cached resources for improved performance
* **App-like experience**: Full-screen mode and native-like interface

### Installing Cuan as a PWA

1. On Chrome/Edge (desktop):
   - Click the install icon in the address bar
   - Follow the prompts to install

2. On Safari (iOS):
   - Tap the Share button
   - Select "Add to Home Screen"
   - Follow the prompts to install

3. On Chrome (Android):
   - Tap the menu button (three dots)
   - Select "Add to Home Screen"
   - Follow the prompts to install

### PWA Features

* **Offline Support**: Basic functionality is available even without an internet connection
* **Auto Updates**: The app automatically updates when new versions are available
* **Native Integration**: Access device features and receive notifications (where supported)
* **Lightweight**: Smaller installation footprint than a traditional app

## Security Considerations

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Never commit `.env` file to version control
   - Use different encryption keys for development and production
   - Keep your production encryption key secure

2. **Token Storage**
   - JWT tokens are encrypted using AES before storage in localStorage
   - Tokens are automatically decrypted when making API requests
   - Failed encryption/decryption is logged with fallback behavior
   - Error handling provides security-related feedback without exposing sensitive details

3. **Authentication**
   - Axios interceptors automatically handle authentication and refresh tokens
   - Toast notifications for authentication errors with appropriate error messages
   - Automatic redirection for expired sessions

4. **Data Security**  
   * Encryption of sensitive financial data  
   * Input validation to prevent injection attacks  
   * Secure API communication
